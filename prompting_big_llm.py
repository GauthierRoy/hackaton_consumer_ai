    You notice that all the weights are set to 0, this is the initial conditions. Try to update the weights in a coherent way given the conversation. 
    Weights are set between 0 (skill not mastered at all), to 1 (skill fully mastered). You must set a weight to each skill given the conversation and the mistakes made. The graph will reflect the level of a student. 
    Fill in the knowledge graph smartly, meaning don't put a high score in a skill in B2 and low score in A1, there should be some logic: mastering B1 means you have good scores in A1 and A2 overall (not necessarily 1 everywhere but 0.8 at least).
    If you feel like the student has a good level, give a good score to the skills that are in equivalent or lower language level even if you haven't necessarily evaluated them. 
    Output the updated graph:
